al o t e poets he takes for his first proof of the superior
nobilitas of the Romans their genealogical descent from
Aeneas. Through his ancestral and matrimonial connexions
Aeneas became the representative of the three continents,
Asia, Africa, and Europe, and so bequeathed to his posterity
the right to regard themselves as heirs of all the ages. A
series of incidents is then cited by Dante as evidence of
the miraculous interposition of God on behalf of this
people, and another series to show that, in accordance with
the maxim, quicumque bonum Reipublicae intendit, finem
iuris intendit (ii. 6. 2), the Romans, alike in their eolleqia
and in the actions of individuals‚ have habitually sacrifieed
themselves for the good of mankind. It was to this end
that they subjected the world to their rule. Their progress,
τοο, was always de iure, nor did they ever act as though
the end alone could justify unlawful means. Again, it is
admitted that illud quod natura ordinavit, de iure servatur
(ii. 7. 1), and that peoples, like individual men, are endowed
by Nature with peculiar gifts. The special mission of the
Roman people Dante finds, where every lover of Virgil has
found it, in the passage containing the famous lines :
Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento,

Parcere subiectis et debellare superbos. (Aen. vi. 851.)
