Latinus and Latino. On the contrary, the senses are
various enough to form an instructive parallel to the
ambiguities of his political theory?

From his reading of classical authors Dante must have
knownssthat, originally, the Latini were merely a people in
Italy against whom the Romans had to fight. As it hap-
pens, there is actually in the De Μ onarchia (ii. 5. 143-58)
a quotation from Cicero, in which the word retains that early
meaning. But since Rome had, politically, swallowed up
her neighbours‚ and had, at the same time, adopted ‘Latin '
as the ‘official language of the Empire'‚ it is intelligible
that Dante should sometimes use Latini and Romam· as
alternative names for the same people. The Florentino
mother in the good old days prattled to her family

De’ Troiani, di Fiesole e di Roma (Par. xv. 126),

but, in allusion to the same legendary descent of Floren-
tine nobles from the ancient race, Dante addresses the
sanquis Lonqobardorum and bids it yield to its betters‚
siquid de Troianorum Latinorumque semine superest (Ep.
v. 51). So far as the sense of Lat-im· is racial‚ it is only
in this local tradition that we find it. But in addition
to this, there are three other senses to be considered.
First, there is Latino as meaning the language which we
too, in modern times, call ‘ Latin ’. Thus, in Book Ι of
the Convivio, where Dante offers an elaborate apology for
writing his commentary in the vulgar rather in the literary
tongue, he uses Latino invariably in this sense. So con-
ceived, ‘ Latin ’ would be the language of the entire
people, however vaguely defined, who can be styled
Latini. In other words, the Latini would be all the
European peoples who were accustomed to use ‘Latin ’
