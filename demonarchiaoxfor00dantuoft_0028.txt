xxiv DE MONARCHIA

appears to come to the very verge of perceiving that the
populus Romanus of the future can be neither the human
ra ce as a whole, nor the inhabitants of the western Empire,
nor ancient Romans lurking at Florence, nor yet itinerant
Germans, but only the Italians, united into a nation ; it
