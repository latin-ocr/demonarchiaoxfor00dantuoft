hostes, for the hostis is one who does not accept your
jurisdiction. For the same reason he will be the guardian
of peace on earth, because war is necessary only when the
combatants acknowledge no authority superior to themselves .
But these functione, however extensive and important,
do not involve territorial ownership (see, however, Gonv.
iv. 4. 36), nor a general right of interference in all kinds
of human affairs. In the convivio (iv. 9) Dante is at some
pains to specify certain limitations of the imperial authority,

to all ideals of International Law and Arbitration ⁶? If so,
it would not be difficult to argue that Dante had some
advantages over his modern rivals. A living and personal
arbiter, invested with all the prestige of the Roman Empire,
