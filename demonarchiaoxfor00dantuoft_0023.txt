INTRODUGTION xix

tionem non habuisset, nisi Romanum Imperium de iure
‘'- fuisset (ii. 13. 45). Whoever‚ therefore, denies the claim
ἶ of the Roman Empire denies that the salvation of man is
effected.

To attack these arguments directly would be at once
easy and futile. Every age must interpret the course of
history in accordance with its own deepest reflections upon
the meaning of the world. It is this alone which gives
value to each fresh interpretation, and only when he pre-
tends to be master of a positive and unalterable science
does the historiari become an impostor. The real difficulties
of Dante’s position will, therefore, best be exhibited, not
by disputing his inferences from history, but by putting
to him a direct question which he never puts to‘ himself.
What is meant by the populus Romanus? It is idle to
refer merely to ancient history, for Dante's object is to
dictate a policy to his contemporaries, and the whole
tenor of the second book forbids us to think any longer
of the Emperor as an isolated official, who exercises
jurisdiction over all nations, but himself belongs to none.

· He is, on the contrary, the head of a people which rules
,the world by right of conquest. Equally impossible is
¹it to suppose that, because the imperial authority knows no
boundaries, the populus Romanus must embrace all man-
* kind. For that would deprive of all meaning the story of
its victory in the struggle. Conquest may in some sense
absorb the whole human race, but the Romans are none
the less a peculiar people. Now in Dante's eyes the only
legitimate claimant to the Empire was a German. shall we
then allow that the populus Romanus is that portentous
race of Teutons‚ which for centuries has been stumbling
(like the English) across the Alps into the land of grapes
