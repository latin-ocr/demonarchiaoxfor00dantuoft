xviii DE MONARGHIA

Passing here to a fresh stage in the argument, Dante

l observes that the judgements of God are made known to
Α man in various ways, by signs, by casting of lots, or
}perchance by means of a certarnen. The certamen may take

two forms, either as a competition, in which the athletes

Κ must not hinder each other unfairly (though Virgil, as

Dante says, seems to have forgotten this in the story of
Nisus and Euryalus), or as a duellum, in which it is the
business of either antagonist to destroy the other as best
he may. Now, with regard to the idea of competition‚
Dante represents the imperium mundi as the prize for which
all peoples have contended. The Assyrian, the Egyptian,
the Persian, the Macedonian, attempted, each in his turn, to
snatch the palm, but in the long procession os Empires it
was RQ& at last which cunctis athletizantibus praevaluit

*³¹³²* and obtained the full mastery of the world. Turning next

to the question of duellum, Dante pushes his saith in

Providential direction to its logical mmm

adopts the argument, quod per duellum adquiritur, de iure
adquiritur (ii. 10. 1), softening it, however, by the admission
that duellum should be regarded as only the last resort,
and by the stipulation that the duellists should be incited
solo zelo iustitiae. In the successive victories of Rgme
over her enemies he sees the fulfilment of the required
conditions and the manifest verdict of God. Lastly, he
refers to the fact that Christ willed to be born sub edicto

*g Romanae auctoritatis, and adds to this the startling doctrine,
:a that Christ's ,atonement for the sin of Adam would have
f been impossible unless the judge who ordered the Cruci-
* fixion had possessed jurisdiction over the whole human
ε race. Tiberius was the judge, et supra totum humanum
