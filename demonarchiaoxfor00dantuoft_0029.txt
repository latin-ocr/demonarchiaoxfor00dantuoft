dependencc of the Empire on the Papacy. This method
of interpreting literature, both sacred and secular, had been
established for centuries, and a specimen of Dante's own
way of employing it will be found at the beginning of
Convicio, Book II. The search for allegory is not lightly
to be condemned as ridiculous, but it is obvious that no
definite results can be established by attempting to decide
between Dante and his opponents as to the inner meaning
of the Oblation of the Magi or the Delivery of the Keys

The subject of that argument, however, belongs rather to
the second portion of the book, beginning at the tenth
chapter, at which point Dante attacks the difficulties
created for him by certain historical events, real or ima-
ginary. Of these the first and most famous is the mythical
Donation of Constantine. Dante's contention is that Con-
stantinus alienare ‘mn poterat Imperii diqnitatem, 'nec

ntitled to offer it. Next to the Donation the most incon-
enient affair was the invitation of Pope Hadrian Ι (a mis-
ake of Dante’s for Leo III) to Charles the Great. That
Charles did in some sense receive the imperial dignity

from the Pope was indisputable, but Dante dismisses the ⁸
