world; (2) whether the Roman people has rightfully
arrogated to itself the monarchical office ; (3) whether the

range and various enough in its individual members for
the development of all that is potentially contained in
the human intellect ; and the most indispensable condition'
for the achievement of this result is the reign of universa ·
peace. Approaching his point in a slightly different way,
Dante observes that, when any complex of diverse element
has to be organized for a single purpose, there must b ⁴
one supreme authority. But since the human race as

a single law of uniform motion is the effect of the one
Supreme Mover, who is God. Turning to more mundane
