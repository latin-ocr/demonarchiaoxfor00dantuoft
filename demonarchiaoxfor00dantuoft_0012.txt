viii DE MONARCHIA

have helped to produce a wrong impression, and it is well

to remember what his ancestor Cacciaguida said to him :

Pero ti son mostrate in queste rote,
Nel monte, 6 nella valle dolorosa,

Pur l'anime che son di fama note. (Par. xvii. 136.)
In actual life he was indeed, by the malice of fortune,
a Prior of the city ; but even this was a rather bourgeois
distinction, which must have fallen to the lot of many
persons of no great importance. So again, his letters to
Henry VII and to the princes and people of Italy, though
successful in exasperating the Florentines, can never have
affected very seriously the prospects of the imperial
adventure. The De M marchia, therefore, owes the greater
part of its importance to the fact that it was written by
the author of the Divina Commedia. Whatever the value
of the arguments contained in it, they will bc more intelli-
gible, and surely more interesting, if we read them in
connexion with the life and thought of Dante, than if we
suppose them to give official expression to the views of
a political party, or to the ambitions of a German prince.
Despite his long and arduous conflict with outward facts,

λ’ the life of Dante remained the life of a seer and a poet.

If on the pages of the Divina Oommedia are refiected all
the personal and political passions of an exile, we shall not
therefore deny that the true subject of the poem is, as

Dante wrote to Can Grande, status animarum post mortem,
or homo, prout merendo et demerendo per arbitrii libertatem

I ustitiae praemianti aut punienti obnoxius est (Ep. x. 169-75).
In the same way, the De M onarchia may be read as the

· solit-ary expression of Dante’s ‘ ac'tive life ⁹, as a political

pamphlet, owing its very existence to the author's desire
to find a theory which might justify him in launching
