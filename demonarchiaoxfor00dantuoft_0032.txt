xxviii DE MONAROHIA

anima Lombarda, thus suggesting the province of Lom-
bardy as a possible unit. A few lines later virgil begins
his address with the name Mantova ; whereupon Sordello
breaks in with the cry :

O Mantovano‚ io son Sordello
Della tua terra.

At this display of the citizen's loyalty to his native place
Dante bursts into an invective against Italy:

Ahi serva Italia, di dolore ostello . . .

and, having thus recognized Italy as a political whole
divided by faction, he next reproaches her for refusing to
submit to the Emperor’s bridle :

Ahi gente, che dovresti esser devota
E lasciar seder Cesare in la sella . . .

Not content with this, he proceeds to remind his country-
men that Caesar happens at present to be a German :

O Alberto Tedesco, che abbandoni
Costei ch' ὲ satta indomita e selvaggia. . .

Finally, in his appeal to this German, he refers to Italy as

il qiardi‘n dell’ imperio, and implies that Rome, merely be-

cause she is Rome, has a special and unique claim to loyalty :
Vieni a veder la tua Roma che piagne . . .

Bewildering as is this series of suggestions, to complete
the tale we have to pass on to the thirteenth canto. Dante
encounters there (Purq. xiii. 91-6) a spirit who proves
to be Sapia of Siena. Tell me, he says,

S’ anima ὸ qui tra voi che sia latina,
and Sapia answers :

Ο frate mio, ciascuna e cittadina
D'una vera citta; ma tu vuoi dire,
Che vivesse in Italia peregrina.
