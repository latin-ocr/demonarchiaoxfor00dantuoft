no need of the two reqimina (cf. De Mon. iii. 4. 107),

, but, as it is, the directive powers of both Emperor and Pope

should be observed that Dante is not thus assigning the
‘ active life ' to the Emperor, and the ‘contemplative '

the intellectual virtues, as well as over the moral, and it

and the respect due from Caesar to Peter is that of a son
to his spiritual father.

Had Dante been a premature Protestant‚ or had he been
any kind of rebel against the authority of the Church, his
argument in the third book would have been far less
interesting, but his defence of the Empire would have been

’ far less difficult. By his perfect loyalty to the successor
of Peter, and by his admission that the Papal sovereignty
in spiritual matters is not limited by political or geographi-
cal boundaries‚ he adds yet one more complication to the
many with which he is already beset. As the result,
