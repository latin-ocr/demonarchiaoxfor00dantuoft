INTRODUCTION ix

a foreign prince against the walls of his native city; but
it may be read also as a vision of the triumph of Justice,
in the establishment of a kingdom appointed by God.
That the political theory of Dante was largely the outcome
of his own misfortunes it would be affectation to deny.
The traditions of his family were not ‘ Ghibelline ⁹, and,
as a good Florentine of moderate position, he would
naturally have been disposed to resent any kind of foreign
interference in the affairs of the city. Yet, at the end of
his life, it might have been said to him, with some show
of justice, that between his‘ own advocacy of Henry VII
and Boniface’s invitation to Charles of Valois there was,
in principle, little to choose. On the other hand, it is but
the shallowest criticism to suggest that a creed founded
on personal experience must therefore be insincere. For,
as the effect of all poignant experience is to open the eyes
to some new form of truth, so by the misfortunes of his
exile Dante gained a wide knowledge of the condition of
Italy and a conviction that a saviour was required. We
cannot follow all the details of his wanderings, but we
know that he visited almost every part of Italy, and that
everywhere he found the same evils. To him it seemed
that there was only one remedy, and the arguments by
which he supported his opinions are those which we are
now to examine in the De M emm-chia. The exact date of the
work is uncertain, but is also, save to the curious in such
matters, unimportant. The same doctrine appears in the
Convivia, in every part of the Divina Commedia, and in
the letters immediately connected with the expedition of
Henry VII. It is, in fact, the only political doctrine
expressed by Dante between the day of his banishment
and the day of his death.
