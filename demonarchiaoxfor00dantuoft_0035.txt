INTRODUCTION xxxi

He who can deny the Sacraments to Prinees and Potentates
needs no populu-3 Romanus, no territory, and no army.
But an Emperor, seated at Rome and elaiming authority
over all nations and peoples, yet himself king of no country
and master of no legions, was from the first a shadow and
a dream. Even now, as we look in vain round the world
for a Mediator enthroned above the strife of nations, there
is only one place where our glance ean linger even for
a moment. The ghost of the Empire, as Hobbes perceived,
must be sought in the Vatican : it has never been to Vienna

or Berlin.
And yet, though we are compelled to admit that Dante,

in his zeal for the peace of Italy, was led to devise a policy

which must have made it impossible for her to become,
a nation, it does not follow that the doctrine of the De ἶ

M onarchia has no longer any meaning for the world. The ²4
birth and independence of modern nations have led to ἶ

mighty results, but is it so certain that they have accom-

l

plished the task imposed by Dante on the Emperor, the ³

triumph of ,Just-ice over F oree ⁶? If Dante is to be called
the prophet of an obsolete Imperialism, it is a fair reply that
the prophet of Nationality is Machiavelli. As a forerunner
of Gavour and modern Italy, Machiavelli was a greater
patriot than Dante, but the spectacle of the Machiavellian
gospel in action has at least provided Europe with food for

meditation.
