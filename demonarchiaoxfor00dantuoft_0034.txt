xxx DE MONARCHIA

the discussion of the term curiale (as applied to the vulqare
Latinum) in the Dc Vulqari Eloquentia. Dante lamente,
first, the absence of a curia in Italy, but then 116 consoles
himself with the thought, licet curia (secundum quod unica
accipitur, ut curia rcyis Alamaniae) in I talia mm sit,
membra tamen eius non desunt (De V. E. i. 18. 46). The
curia, 116 means, can exist without a princeps, in so far as
it is a spiritual unity ; but he forgets to add that the court

and no effort of Dante's genius could convert a German
invasion into an exile's return. Italy has found it hard

Dante would have had it, would have been a less serious
obstacle than the Empire to the growth of an Italian nation.

For a Pope can enforce his jurisdiction by spiritual edicts,
