xii DE MONAROHIA

arguments, Dante proposes next the maxim, ubicumque
potest esse litigium, ibi debet esse iudicium (i. 10. 1). ,A
dispute between equals must be referred to a third party
for decision, but no decision can be final unless you come
up, sooner or later, to an ultimate court of appeal, such as
only a Monarch can provide. Or again, the perfect mani-
festation of Justice implies the total absence of cupiditas.
But how can this be possible? Only by accepting the
principle, ubi uon est quod possit optari, impossibile est ibi
cupiditatem esse (i. ll. 78). To such a position the Monarchâ€š
and the Monarch alone, can attain, for, since his jurisdiction
l reaches to the ends of the earth, there is nothing left to
tempt his cupidity. Reflecting, perhaps, at this point
that when Alexander had no more worlds to conquer
he then began to complain, Dante proceeds to argue that
this Monarchy, far from passing into despotism, is itself
the fulfilment and safeguard os liberty. {grue liberty does
not mean an equal exposure to good an to evil, but con-
firmation in the way of goodness. It means, too, that
the free man or free people lives suimet et mm alterius qratia
(i. 12. 50). Such liberty is found in rightly ordered, as
opposed to corrupt, states3 for in the former the ruler
makes the good of the subjects his end, and does not treat
them as instruments to his own advantage. Above all
Nothers the supreme Monaroh will exemplify this principle.
=Havi11g no scope for cupiditas, he will love his subjecte
ssperfectly, and will be perfectly loved by them. His char-
acter will be that of minister omnium, a title which may
pass as a secular rival os the servus servorum of the Popes.
From this idealized picture of the Monarchy Dante then
returns to more abstract principles, and first to the aphorism,
quod potest fleri per unum, melius est per unum fieri quam
