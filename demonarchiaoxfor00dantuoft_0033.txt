INTRODUOTION xxix

Sapia herself has finished her earthly course, but her words
remind us that, in ecclesiastical writers, patria is the name
commonly given to Heaven‚ in contrast with the via which
man has to traverse on earth. A student of Dante and of
mediaeval Italy has to recognize in this celestial patriotism
something more than a metaphor. It means, in effect,
’the acceptance of the Papal sovereignty upon earth ; and
that sovereignty‚ however spiritual by nature, too often
brought the Popes into conflicts which had to be waged with
weapons strangely material. Up to a point Dante is fully
aware of this difficulty, and for that very reason he desires
to remove the Pope from the political arena by conferring
)the tempora} monarchy on the Emperor. He fails, how ever, ., ⁶
to see that a Roman Emperor with universal jurisdiction
would be just as fatal to Italy as a Pope who was, in one
aspect, merely one among many Italian princes, in another
a claimant to spiritual empire. Under the actual conditions
of the time the Emperor must, indeed, have been by far
the graver menace of the two. For the Pope might at
least be an Italian, and Rome was unquestionably the
capital of his kingdom. Thus, when Dante writes to the
Cardinals and urges them to fight, pro Sponsa Christi, pro
sede Sponsae, quae Roma est, pro Italia nostra, et ut plenius
dicam, pro tota civitate pereyrimntium in terris (Ep. viii.
178-81)‚ he calls up a picture of a kingdom at once Italian
and universal. And when he bids them strive too, ut
Vasconum opprobrium, qui tam dira cupidine confla-
9rante3 Latinorum qloriam sibi usurpare contendunt, per
caecula cuncta sutura sit posteris in exemplum (ibid. 186-90),
he sets the metropolitan glory of Rome against the provin-
cialism of Avignon‚ and makes an appeal to the Latini
which they could scarcely resist. But compare with this
