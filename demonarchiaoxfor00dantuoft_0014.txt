x DE MONARCHIA

In the opening chapter of the treatise we come upon the
rather surprising fact that Dante regards himself as a
pioneer. The study of Monarchia temporalis, he says, is
inter alias veritates occultas . . . utilissima et maxime latens ε
he even goes so far as to call it ab omnibus intentata (i. 1.
27-31). Now the controversy itself was already ancient
enough, and many of the arguments mentioned in the
De M onarchia were by no means invented by Dante.

jThere may, perhaps, have been some novelty in the fact

that he was neither an ecclesiastic nor a lawyer ; but, on
the whole, it is best to assume that he conceived his treat-

This much, at least, must be admitted, that Dante does
not pretend to base his main contentions upon either
the ancient or the modern author whom he held in the
highest esteem. Allusions to Aristotle are frequent, but

fone has only to read a passage like the opening of De Mon.

to the case of the Empire Dante ceased to be a disciple of

monarchy to other forms of government, but he is thinking
only of a state limited in area, and he is at considerable
pains to warn the monarch against the danger of becom-

Monarch an absolute authority over all the world, and
argues that only in such an Empire will the danger of
tyranny disappear. Dante's theory, then, may be taken
as representing his own thought and convictions, and
