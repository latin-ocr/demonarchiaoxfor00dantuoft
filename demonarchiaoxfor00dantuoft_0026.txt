as their literary language. When Sordello addresses
virgil :
Ο gloria de' Latin, disse, per eui
Mostro cio che potea la lingua nostra,
(Purq. vii. 16),

it is possible (though not quite certain) that the word has
this wide implication. Meanwhile, in the same book of
the Convivia, the language that we should eall ‘ Italian ’
is usually styled il volqare, but sometimes l’Italica loquela
(Conv. i. 10. 106) or lo parlare Italico (Conv. i. 11. 99).

Seconffly, there is an important sense, of frequent occur-
rence, in which ‘ Latin ³ is not linguistic but geographieal.
It then refers exclusively to Italy. For example, the terra
Latina of I ns xxvii. 27 and xxviii. 71 is simply Italy, just
as, in I ns. xxii. 65, Latino means an Italian. An even better
example is found in the De Vulqari Eloquentia. Diseussing
there certain linguistie affinities and differences, Dante
writes as follows ε ”

Nam alii oc, alii oil, alii εὶ, affirmando loquuntur; ut

puta Hispani, Franci et Latini. (De V. E. i. 8. 42.)
111 the same work (e. g. De V. E. i. 18. 19) we find Italus
for an inhabitant of Italy, and it would seem that Dante
was as ready to use the one name as the other.
[Thirdly, the most momentous fact of all is found in
this same treatise on the vulgar tongue. For whereas
in Commo, i, Dante had reserved Latino for the literary
language, in the De Vulq. Eloq. it is the vernacula-r, so far
as there exist-s one worthy to become the language of all
Italy, that he constantly describes as Latinum vulqare or
Latinum illustre or Latinum curiale. Just as there are
many dialeets peculiar to this or that region of Italy, sic
istud quod totius I taliae est, Latinum valqare vocatur (De V. E,
