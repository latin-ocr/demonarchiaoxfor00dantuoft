i. 19. 14). Dante's whole aim, in fact, is to discover or
to constitute a language to be styled Latinum vulqare, and
to be used by the entire terra Latina, which is Italy. Of
such a language he was himself, one might almost say, the
creator ; and the Divina Commedia is the first and greatest
manifesto 01 the Latinum vulqare which was to succeed
and, in a sense, to supplant the Latin 01 Virgffl

What, then, is the significance 01 Dante's linguistic
theory and practice? It is that he destroyed 101· ever
in the realm 01 language the very creed which he cham-
pioned so gallantly in⁹the realm 01 politicS. Linguistically
the Divina Commcdia creates a single and united Italy,
which expels from itself all invaders from beyond the Alps,
and absorbs into itself imperial Rome. Unhappily‚ it
was beyond the insight and the power 01 Dante to attempt
the same achievement‘ in politics. He can see the wounds
and divisions of Italy, but he can see no physician but the
Emperor. He cannot grasp the mighty paradox, that
Rome has ever been an alien in Italy, and he is left with
a divided allegiance, which he firmly believes to be single
and pure. He can adapt to Hem-y V Π the words 01 Mercury
to Aeneas (Aen. iv. 274) :

Ascanium surgentem et spes heredis Iuli
Respice, cui regnum Italiae Romanaque tellus

Debentur (cf. Ep. vii. 90),
without perceiving that the Romana tellus conflicts with
the reqnum Italiae, and without, it would seem, any con-
sciousness 01 the absurdity of inviting a German to take
possession 01 them both. Those, therefore, who have
saluted Dante as the herald 01 modern Italy are as utterly
wrong in relation to politics as they are utterly right in
relation to literature. &pr though,‘to our eyeS, Dante
